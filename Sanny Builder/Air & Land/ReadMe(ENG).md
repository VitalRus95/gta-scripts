- the player can choose either Hydra or Rustler to use

- if you have less than $500, your money and weapons are saved after death
- "Peaceful mode", when neutral planes do not become hostile
- built-in menu with some functions and help
- mod's settings are saved in an external file
- this mod is a Mission Pack, which means you can choose between Air & Land, standard SA, or other MPACKs
- new HUD elements: your plane's health and hostile aircraft counter
- Russian and English languages
- dynamic difficulty

__*__ You must be in the chosen plane to get rewards for taking down enemies!


## Installation:
First of all, you need __CLEO 4__ library.
Then copy the mod files here:
_MPACK -> My Documents/GTA San Andreas User Files_.
If you want to use the Russian version, install the localisation by __SanLtd__ (located in the root folder).

>__(!)__ If you already have an MPACK with the same number:
1) change the folder's name from MPACK6 to MPACK(any free number from 1 to 24);
2) in that folder, open mpack.dat and put the same number as the folder has in the beginning of the line.

To see the built-in menu, press __"Answer No"__ button.

>Thanks to all for help, advice, and patience!
